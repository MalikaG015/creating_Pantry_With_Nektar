Language used-Javascript,nodejs,express
Database used- Mongodb

Description of the project-
In this project, I have used RESTful APIs to creat a pantry for a user. Pantry is a free service that provides perishable data storage for small projects. Data is securely stored for as long as any user needs it and is deleted after a period of inactivity. 
Inside pantry, a user can create different buckets for storage of data and perform various operations on that data like updation of data, reading of data and can also delete any bucket if data inside it is not needed.

List of files and folders included in this project-
1. I have in together created 6 APIs for this project. 
2. You can find the list of all APIs in the route.js file inside routes folders. 
3. I have created 2 files for models-pantryModel.js and basketModel.js inside models folder.
4. I have created 2 files for controllers-pantryController.js where you can find the APIs for creating pantry and getting details of the pantry.
And basketController.js where you can find the APIs performing CRUD(create,read,update,delete) operations on basket.
5. I have created a file validator.js inside utils folders where all functions for validation are defined.

NOTE-basketModel has one field called otherItems which can contain any type of value in it so its an dynamic field. I have made otherItems as dynamic using new mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed

My task was to create a 5 APIs. Below are the description of all APIs-
1. 1st API was to get details of the pantry using pantryId.
http method used- GET
Before getting the details of the pantry, I have created an API for creating pantry in which I am passing user email and pantry name from request body and all my pantry data is stored in the mongodb. Each document in the pantry collection has a unique pantryId which was automatically generated by the mongodb database.
To get the deatils of the specific pantry, I passed its pantryId in the path params in the URL and search that pantryId in the database and returned its details in the response.

Response example-
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Pantry created successfully",
    "data": "620656bee538b254d6170c88"
}
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Pantry details are",
    "data": {
        "name": "SunRise",
        "description": "defaultDescription",
        "errors": [],
        "notifications": true,
        "bucketData": [],
        "percentFull": 0
    }
}
  




2. 2nd API was to create a basket using pantryId and basketName 
http method used-POST
To create a basket, I have passed pantryId of the pantry in which I want to add a basket and basketName of my basket in the path params. If basket name given in the params is already present in the database then it will replace the existing content or else it will add a new bucket in that pantry. In request body, we can add otherItems if we want to add. In respone, I will get the details of my basket that I created including all timestamps.

response example-
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Basket created successfully2",
    "data": {
        "name": "managementData",
        "ttl": "2022-02-11T12:35:30.631Z",
        "pantryId": "620656bee538b254d6170c88",
        "otherItems": {
            "disk": 2
        },
        "_id": "62065812f88422e94d618c4a",
        "createdAt": "2022-02-11T12:35:30.643Z",
        "updatedAt": "2022-02-11T12:35:30.643Z",
        "__v": 0
    }
}

3. 3rd API was to update the contents of the basket using pantryId and basketName.
http method used-PUT
To update content of a basket, I have passed pantryId of the pantry and basketName of my basket in which I want to add a basket in the path params.
In the request body I will give the fields which I want to update. In response, I will get the details of the updated basket including timestamps. 

response example-
{
    "status": true,
